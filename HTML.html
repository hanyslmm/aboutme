                Hey! I'm <strong>Hany Salama</strong>. Coding has changed my world.
                Ir's not just about apps. learning to code gave me <i>problem-solving skills</i>
                and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. I can also develop websites and use my coding
                skills to get better job. and I learned it all at Udacity. where you'll have fun,
                get help, and learn along the way!
